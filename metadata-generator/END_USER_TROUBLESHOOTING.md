## üõ†Ô∏è Common Solutions

### Missing FFmpeg Libraries
**Symptoms:** App launches but crashes when trying to analyze video/audio files

**Solution 1 (Recommended):**
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if you don't have it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install FFmpeg
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Solution 2 (Alternative):**
1. Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Install it in your Applications folder
3. The app will automatically detect it there

### Architecture Mismatch
**Symptoms:** App won't launch at all

**Check your Mac's architecture:**
```bash
uname -m
```
- `x86_64` = Intel Mac
- `arm64` = Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac

**Solutions:**
- **Intel Mac with ARM64 app:** Not compatible, need x86_64 version
- **Apple Silicon Mac with x86_64 app:** Should work with Rosetta 2

### macOS Version Issues
**Symptoms:** App won't launch

**Check your macOS version:**
```bash
sw_vers -productVersion
```

**Requirements:** macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

## üìã Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### If the app doesn't appear in Activity Monitor:

1. **Check if it's actually running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep MetadataGenerator
   ```

2. **Check for missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   otool -L /Applications/MetadataGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/MetadataGenerator
   ```

3. **Look for "not found" libraries** in the output above

4. **Install missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

### If the app launches but crashes:

1. **Check Console.app** for crash logs
2. **Try the CLI version** instead:
   ```bash
   # If you have the source code
   cargo run --features cli -- -p /path/to/your/folder
   ```

### If you get permission errors:

1. **Fix permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x /Applications/MetadataGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/MetadataGenerator
   ```

2. **Check file ownership:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /Applications/MetadataGenerator.app/Contents/MacOS/
   ```
