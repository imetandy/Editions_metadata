### App Crashes When Analyzing Files?
This is usually due to missing FFmpeg libraries. Install them:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if you don't have it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install FFmpeg
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Option 2 (Alternative):**
1. Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Install it in your Applications folder
3. The app will automatically detect it there

### Still Having Issues?
1. Check the full troubleshooting guide: `END_USER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
2. Run the diagnostic script and include its output when asking for help
3. Try the CLI version if the GUI doesn't work
