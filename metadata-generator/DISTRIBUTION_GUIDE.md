# How to Share Your App

## What You Have

You now have a professional installer that looks like it came from a real software company:

- **DMG Installer** - A nice installer that users can double-click
- **App Bundle** - A simple app file users can drag to Applications
- **ZIP File** - A compressed version for easy sharing

## Ways to Share

### Option 1: GitHub Releases (Best)

This is the easiest and most professional way:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Releases"** on the right side
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Add a version tag** like `v1.0.0`
5. **Upload your DMG file**
6. **Write a simple description**
7. **Click "Publish release"**

Now anyone can download your app from the releases page!

### Option 2: Email or File Sharing

Simply share the DMG file:
- **Email** it as an attachment
- **Upload** to Google Drive or Dropbox
- **Share** via your company's file server
- **Copy** to a USB drive

## For Your Users

Tell them to:

1. **Download** the DMG file
2. **Double-click** it to open
3. **Drag** the app to Applications
4. **Launch** from Applications

That's it! No complicated installation needed.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### App Won't Open
- Make sure they're using macOS 10.15 or later
- They might need to right-click and choose "Open" the first time
- This is normal for apps not from the App Store

### Can't Download
- Check the file size (should be around 2.7MB)
- Try downloading again
- Make sure they have enough disk space

## Making Updates

When you want to share a new version:

1. **Build** the new installer
2. **Create** a new release on GitHub
3. **Upload** the new DMG file
4. **Tell** your users about the update

## Tips

- **Keep it simple** - users just want to download and use
- **Test first** - make sure the installer works on a clean Mac
- **Version numbers** - use simple numbers like 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
- **Clear instructions** - tell users exactly what to do
