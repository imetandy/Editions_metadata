# Professional Installer Guide

## What This Is

You now have a professional installer that makes your app look like it came from a real software company. It's a DMG file that users can double-click to install your app.

## What Makes It Professional

- **Looks great** - matches how other Mac apps are installed
- **Easy to use** - users just drag and drop
- **Small file** - only 2.7MB, downloads quickly
- **Works everywhere** - runs on any Mac with 10.15 or later
- **No setup needed** - everything is included

## How to Make the Installer

### Quick Way
```bash
./scripts/create-dmg-installer.sh
```

This will:
1. Build your app
2. Create the installer
3. Clean up temporary files
4. Give you a DMG file ready to share

## How to Share It

### Best Option: GitHub Releases
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Releases"**
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Upload your DMG file**
5. **Publish the release**

### Other Options
- **Email** the DMG file
- **Upload** to Google Drive or Dropbox
- **Share** on your company's file server

## For Your Users

Tell them to:

1. **Download** the DMG file
2. **Double-click** it to open
3. **Drag** the app to Applications
4. **Launch** from Applications

That's it! No complicated steps.

## If You Need to Update

When you want to share a new version:

1. **Make your changes** to the code
2. **Run the build script** again
3. **Create a new release** on GitHub
4. **Upload the new DMG file**

## Troubleshooting

### Installer Won't Open
- Make sure the file downloaded completely
- Try downloading again
- Check that you have macOS 10.15 or later

### App Won't Launch
- Right-click the app and choose "Open" the first time
- This is normal for apps not from the App Store

### File Too Big
- The installer should be around 2.7MB
- If it's much bigger, something went wrong with the build

## Tips

- **Test first** - try the installer on a clean Mac before sharing
- **Keep it simple** - users don't want complicated instructions
- **Version numbers** - use simple numbers like 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
- **Clear descriptions** - tell users what's new in each version
